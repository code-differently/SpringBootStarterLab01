Building the model and its unit tests

# The Model Layer

The model consists of two entities that is managed by the service.  
⇒
[Widget.java](../../phonebook/src/test/java/com/codedifferently/phonebook/widgets/models/Widget.java)  
⇒
[WidgetPart.java](../../phonebook/src/test/java/com/codedifferently/phonebook/widgets/models/WidgetPart.java)  

1.  Mark the object as an JPA entity  

    1.  Look for the `@Entity` above the class declaration.

2.  Add the persistence annotations  

    1.  The `@Table` annotation provides a database table name that
        corresponds to the `Todo` entity.

    2.  The `@Id` annotation marks the `id` field as a row identifier
        primary key.  

    3.  The `@GeneratedValue` annotation implies that the value is
        generated by the database.  

    4.  The `@Column` annotation provides the column name for the field.
        The column name can be different from the field name as shown in
        case of the `activeFlag` field. The column name in the database
        table can be different from the field name.

# The Model unit test

The model is simply a few attributes, the test focuses on the equals,
hashCode and the toString.  
⇒
[WidgetTest.java](../../phonebook/src/test/java/com/codedifferently/phonebook/widgets/models/models/WidgetTest.java)

1.  There are four `Widget` instances in the test.

2.  Two instances: `widget1` and `widget2` have the same content while
    two other instances `emptyWidget1` and `emptyWidget2` are empty.

3.  The aim of this test is to ensure code coverage of all methods other
    than the getters and setters.

# Exercise Lab

![Lab](images/labtime.png)

1.  Create an Person object in the
    \<your-lastname\>.training.spring.boot.lab package and create its
    unit test.

2.  The Person contains the following fields:

    -   id (`Integer`)

    -   firstName (`String`)

    -   lastName (`String`)

    -   phoneNumbers(`List<phoneNumber>`).

3.  Create an PhoneNumber object in the
    \<your-lastname\>.training.spring.boot.lab package and create its
    unit test.

4.  The PhoneNumber contains the following fields:

    -   id (`Integer`)

    -   phoneNumber (`String`)

    -   isMobile (`Boolean`)
